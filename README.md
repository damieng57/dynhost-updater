# DynHost Client Updater
This small python script is a dynamic DNS client for OVH's DynHost ([https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/domains/hosting_dynhost/](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/domains/hosting_dynhost/)).

**Note** : The `getCurrentIp()` function has to be edited to fit your needs. It currently recovers the WAN IP address from Orange's Livebox.
